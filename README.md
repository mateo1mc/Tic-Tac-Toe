# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game created using Python's Turtle graphics library and tkinter for message box functionality.


## How to Play

- Run the Python script.
- Click on the square where you want to place your mark (either 'X' or 'O').
- The game alternates between 'X' and 'O' marks.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.


## Instructions

- The Tic Tac Toe board is displayed with a grid layout.
- 'X' marks are drawn in blue, and 'O' marks are drawn in red.
- When the game ends, a message box appears indicating the result (win, lose, or tie).
- You can choose to play again or quit the game from the message box.


## Controls

Click on a square on the grid to place your mark.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
